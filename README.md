This repository demonstrates a common error in Elixir when using `Enum.reduce`.  The issue arises from implicitly returning the last value of an `if` statement within the reducer function, rather than explicitly returning the accumulator. This leads to incorrect results, especially if the list ends with an odd number. The `bug.ex` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.ex` provides a corrected version.
